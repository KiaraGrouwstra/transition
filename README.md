## positions on trans healthcare (Dutch):
- [care should not be limited to 'multi-disciplinary' clinics](./multi-disciplinary.md)
- [care should not require an in-take of 'gatekeeping' by psychologists](./psychs.md)
- [hair removal of body and limbs for trans women should (at the behest of a medical specialist) be covered by insurance](./dehairing.md)
