Estrogen injections seem like a nice alternative to other methods due to easy absorption of high levels of estrogen, but appear not to have been registered by the [inspectie volksgezondheid](https://www.igj.nl/).

As a result of this, transgenders looking to acquire such injections are currently pushed toward the [black market](http://lena.kiev.ua/).

Types:
- estradiol valerate (injections every 5 days)
- estradiol enanthate (injections every 7 or 10 days, pricier)
- estradiol hemihydrate
