Implants are small capsules used to diffuse a given substance in the body.
This has been used for e.g. [contraception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etonogestrel_birth_control_implant), but could conceivably be adapted to instead diffuse estrogen for transgender hormone therapy.

I contacted [MSD](https://msd.nl/contact/) (Organon), the manufacturer of Implanon contraception implants, to ask about this idea.
They responded having done no research into transgender hormone therapy, and were unlikely to look into this area anytime soon.
